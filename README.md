# Pentarisc

This will be a RISC-V emulator and miscellaneous tools implemented in Haskell.

The components specifically planned are:

*   emulator for a RISC-V processor
*   rudimentary hardware model for memory and I/O
*   RISC-V assembler

This has no aspirations to be a useful industrial tool;
it is purely for personal fun and no profit.
